# Deciphering the Genomic Landscape Through ECG Signal Analysis: During Rest
## Bachelor's degree final project
### Problem Statement:
Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals offer a window into heart physiology. However, the connection between these physiological signals and individual genetic makeup remains underexplored. This project aims to uncover associations between genetic variationsâ€”particularly Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms and latent features extracted from ECG signals at rest using deep learning, with the goal of deepening our understanding of genetic influences on cardiovascular health.

### **The data:**
---
The dataset consists of nearly 10,000 ECG recordings from cycling sessions documented in the UK Biobank. Each session includes both rest and active phases. We worked on the rest data. This dataset offers rich information, including:

        o Multi-lead ECG recordings sampled at 500Hz
        o Associated metadata such as heart rate, RPM, and session configurations.
        o Genetic profiles of the participants for SNP analysis.

### **Methodology:**
---
This project leverages a 1D Resifual Convolutional Neural Network Autoencoder to extract latent features from time-dependent ECG signals. These features are then associated with genetic variations using genome-wide association study techniques.
_Key steps include:_

        > Data Preprocessing: Filtering ECG signals to remove high and low-frequency noise.
        > Feature Extraction: Training a 1D-CNN-AE model to represent the signals in a compressed latent space with minimal information loss.
        > Genomic Analysis: Testing SNPs for associations with the latent features using PLINK2, with multiple testing corrections via Bonferroni.
        > Gene Clustering: Identifying significant SNPs, mapping them to genes using HaploReg, and clustering these genes based on functional relationships using STRING.

### **Scientific Innovation:**

1) Applying CNN autoencoder.
2) Using ECG information with additional clinical data.
3) Comparing ECG during rest vs. exercise training.
4) Filtering the data before the autoencoder.
